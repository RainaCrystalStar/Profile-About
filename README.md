Hey, welcome to my GitHub. 

I'm a digital artist who is new to the coding world. But I'm willing to learn new things as I stay and learn about GitHub. My aim is to understand webhooks and trying to sync it to discord thou the webhook.

I also make comics based on my own original art work. I do however have a discord server which is private and only
Used for fans and friendships.

I will be definitely making codes in my coding file that I've made on my repository listed outside of my
Demain. 

If you have any questions or concerns please inbox me at anytime.
