Hey there, I'm a digital artist who is new to the coding world. But I'm willing to learn new things as I stay and learn about GitHub. My aim is to understand webhooks and trying to sync it to discord thou the webhook.

I also make comics based on my own original art work. I do however have a discord server which is private and only
Used for fans and friendships.

I will be definitely making codes in my coding file that I've made on my repository listed outside of my
Demain.
