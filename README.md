Hey there, I'm a digital artist and I'm very new to the coding world. But I'm willing to learn new things as I stay and learn about GitHub. My aim is to understand webhooks And using Github with my discord server thou webhook.

I also make comics based on my own original art work. I love making new chapter and storylines so maybe this site might be some use in that area. I wouldn't say I'm a games developer, but who knows what is around the corner. 

I will be definitely making codes in my coding file that I've made on my repository listed outside of my this repository.
